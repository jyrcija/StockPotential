1. Copy numbers from annual reports
2. Set the current share price
2. Create three scenarios based on company guidance, analysts etc (this is the hardest part but it does not need to be perfect)
3. Set the P/E (target) value (how much you think investors would value the company if the scenario realizes)
4. By changing the share price (step 2) you can figure how low you need to buy to address your annualized return
